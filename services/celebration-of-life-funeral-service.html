    <h1>Celebration of Life/Funeral Service</h1>

    <p>
      A Celebration of Life/Funeral Service that truly reflects and honors your
      loved one is one of the last gifts you can give them. It is a gift that
      also gives you and all in attendance some closure and precious memories to
      ease your grief.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a Certified Funeral Celebrant with the Life Celebrants of Canada, I
      would love to help you create a service that reflects your loved one’s
      values, interests and personality, and honors them for their outstanding
      qualities and contributions. A service that demonstrates appreciation for
      your unique and important heritage. This is a very stressful time but I
      want to help you do this well<!--, and I will give you a printed copy of the service as a keepsake-->.
    </p>

    <p>
      Calgary and the surrounding area have an abundance of indoor venues and
      outdoor areas with beautiful scenery for Celebration of Life Services.
      Small services could be held at your home or mine. I would love to work
      with you to create a memorable service.

          >Susan Hodgins was incredible to work with for my grandfather's
          celebration of life. Her compassionate and caring nature was a true
          asset during a very difficult time. She spoke very eloquently and made
          sure the service ran smoothly. Sue was very accommodating to what was
          important to my family and I for honoring my grandfather. I'm so glad
          she was there to lead the service and I highly recommend her to anyone
          looking to have a professional funeral celebrant.</q
