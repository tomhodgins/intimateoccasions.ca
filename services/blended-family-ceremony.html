    <h1>Blended Family Ceremony</h1>

    <p>
      Weaving two families together into one is a delicate and very important
      transition that can be solidified and enriched by a Blended Family
      Ceremony.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would love to help you create a ceremony where each person is assured
      that their unique contributions will be respected, valued and appreciated,
      and that each child holds a special place in the heart of both parents.
      One that enables parents and children to communicate their desire to give
      each other understanding and support through life’s ups and downs. A
      ceremony that will help you define your shared values and goals and elicit
      attitudes of cooperation and motivation. A printed copy of your ceremony
      will give you a meaningful keepsake.
    </p>

    <p>
      Calgary and the surrounding area have an abundance of indoor ceremony
      venues and outdoor areas with breathtaking scenery in every season! Small
      ceremonies could be held at your home or mine. I would love to create a
      personal and meaningful ceremony that will help you enjoy doing life
      together!
