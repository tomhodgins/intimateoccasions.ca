    <h1>Wedding Vow Renewal Ceremony</h1>

    <p>
      Investing in a Wedding Vow Renewal Ceremony will produce ongoing dividends
      that greatly enrich your marriage! It will bring back the thrill of your
      wedding day as you reaffirm loving words of passion and commitment. You
      may repeat your original vows or write new ones that hold fresh meaning in
      your journey of love. These are the words that echo in your spouse’s mind
      and heart, even when you are apart. A Renewal Ceremony gives your marriage
      security and focus as you look forward to realizing shared hopes and
      dreams. It gives you an opportunity to express appreciation to your
      children and others who have supported your marriage, and receive
      meaningful words of affirmation from them.
      <!--A printed copy of your renewal ceremony will become a treasured family keepsake.-->
    </p>

    <p>
      Wedding Vow Renewal Ceremonies have become popular for many reasons: to
      celebrate an anniversary, to include children or parents in the ceremony,
      to celebrate with a larger circle of family and friends if the original
      ceremony was an elopement or destination wedding, to replace memories of a
      disappointing wedding day, to reaffirm your commitment when facing
      deployment or an extended time apart, or to celebrate making it through a
      difficult time of illness, relationship challenge or financial crisis. Any
      time is a good time for a Wedding Vow Renewal Ceremony!
    </p>

    <p>
      Calgary and the surrounding area have an abundance of indoor ceremony
      venues and outdoor areas with breathtaking scenery in every season! Small
      ceremonies could be held at your home or mine. I would love to work with
      you to create a personal and meaningful ceremony!
