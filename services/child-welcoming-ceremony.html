    <h1>Child Welcoming Ceremony</h1>

    <p>
      Children are a precious gift whether received by birth or adoption!
      Whenever a child comes into a loving family circle it is time to
      celebrate!
    </p>

    <p>
      A Child Welcoming Ceremony allows you to tell your story of anticipation
      and joy! You may wish to reveal the significance behind the names you have
      chosen and receive a prayer of blessing for your child. You may talk about
      your family heritage and give your child a meaningful gift. Extended
      family and friends may wish to express their delight and offer words of
      love and support that will be a constant encouragement. The possibilities
      are endless!
    </p>

    <p>
      Calgary and the surrounding area have an abundance of indoor ceremony
      venues and outdoor areas with breathtaking scenery in every season! I
      would love to work with you to create a personal and meaningful ceremony!
